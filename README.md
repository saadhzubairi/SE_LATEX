# SE_LATEX
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. <br>

<b>The Software I made makes it simple for users to generate PDFs in LaTeX without learning the syntax of LaTeX at all.</b>

<ul>
<li>Text Addition with sections and subsections options, which also includes adding a numbered list as well as file paths and directories in monospace in the middle of the text.</li>

<li>An Undo Button.</li>
<li>A Separate list addition menu for adding file paths and directories with vertical spacing.</li>
