# LaTeX Simplified
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. <br>
<br>
<b>The Software I made makes it simple for users to generate PDFs in LaTeX without learning the syntax of LaTeX at all.</b>

# Features:

1. Text Addition with sections and subsections options, which also includes adding a numbered list as well as file paths and directories in monospace in the middle of the text.
2. A zoomable Preview Pane for a rough idea what the final generated pdf will look like.
3. An Undo Button.
4. A Separate list addition menu for adding lists all together.
5. Seperate menu for adding file paths and directories with vertical spacing.
6. A menu to add code as a listed or non listed item with and without pre-text.
7. A section to edit and add pre-amble text.
8. A Seperate screen for viewing and copying resultant generated text to be used as input for LaTeX.
